This directory contains a number of tools related to policy, some of
which are used in building and validating the policy and others are
available for help in auditing and analyzing policy.  The tools are
described further below.

checkfc
   A utility for checking the validity of a file_contexts or a
   property_contexts configuration file.  Used as part of the policy
   build to validate both files.  Requires the sepolicy file as an
   argument in order to check the validity of the security contexts
   in the file_contexts or property_contexts file.

   Usage:
   checkfc sepolicy file_contexts
   checkfc -p sepolicy property_contexts

checkseapp
    A utility for merging together the main seapp_contexts
    configuration and the device-specific one, and simultaneously
    checking the validity of the configurations. Used as part of the
    policy build process to merge and validate the configuration.

    Usage:
    checkseapp -p sepolicy input_seapp_contexts0 [input_seapp_contexts1...] -o seapp_contexts

insertkeys.py
    A helper script for mapping tags in the signature stanzas of
    mac_permissions.xml to public keys found in pem files.  This
    script is described further in the top-level sepolicy/README.

post_process_mac_perms
    A tool to help modify an existing mac_permissions.xml with additional app
    certs not already found in that policy. This becomes useful when a directory
    containing apps is searched and the certs from those apps are added to the
    policy not already explicitly listed.

    Usage:
    post_process_mac_perms [-h] -s SEINFO -d DIR -f POLICY

      -s SEINFO, --seinfo SEINFO  seinfo tag for each generated stanza
      -d DIR, --dir DIR           Directory to search for apks
      -f POLICY, --file POLICY    mac_permissions.xml policy file

sepolicy-check
    A tool for auditing a sepolicy file for any allow rule that grants
    a given permission.

    Usage:
    sepolicy-check -s <domain> -t <type> -c <class> -p <permission> -P out/target/product/<board>/root/sepolicy

sepolicy-analyze
    A tool for performing various kinds of analysis on a sepolicy
    file.
